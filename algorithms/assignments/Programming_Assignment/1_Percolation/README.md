# [Programming Assignment 1: Percolation_Without_Weighted_Quick_Union](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)

Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.


## Problem Statement 

In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates. The plots below show the site vacancy probability p versus the percolation probability for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).

## 2 Re-implemented Percolation Data Structure
 
This is based on 2 dimensional array (for grid) and recursive calls (for checking the grid).
This is not a requirement for the assignment.
