# [Introduction to Algorithms & Data Structures](https://class.coursera.org/algs4partI-005)


** Date: 2014.06.18 ~ **

A couple of weeks ago, I decided to take algorithm courses offered from Princeton University through Coursera.
This place is the repository for the course.


## Material

* [Official Textbook](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X)
* [Official Textbook Online Material](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)
* [Book: Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-0-lCFwHeVSNW1KZGJQazVlUUk/edit?usp=sharing)
* Video Lectures

## Why do we bother Algorithms? 

1. It is to solve problems that could not be otherwise addressed.
2. "Great algorithms are poetry of computations."
3. Algorithms + Data Structures = Program
4. Good programmers focus on Algorithms while poor programmers focus on codes.
5. It is a representation of computational method. (Complex mathematical solutions)


## Topics covered in Part I

- **Data Types**: stack, queue, bag, union-find, priority queue.
- **Sorting**: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sort.
- **Searching**: BST, red-black BST, hash table.
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, Orun, kruskal, Dijkstra.
- **Strings**: KMP, Regex, TST, Huffman, LZW.
- **Advanced**: Binary Tree, Suffix Array, Maxflow.

## Folders

- Lecture: All lectures and notes.
- Assignments: A directory for my assignments (Java).
- Funstuffs: My playground for learning algorithms. (Not necessary Java)
- Data: basic input data provided by the course.
- Lib: Standard java classes and Algorithm course specific java classes, written by the professors
