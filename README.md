============

## Algorithms and Data Structures

* School: **Princeton University**
* Professor: Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
* Textbook: [Algorithms 4th edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home)
* [Java Programs in the textbook](http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/code/)
* [Algorithm codes in the textbook](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/)
* **How I apply Algorithms at work**:
    1. Web Scrapping:
        * Effectively download and parse publicly available data such as Community Forum RSS feeds, Verizon reviews, 
          Amazon reviews, Google Playstore reviews, Tweets etc.
        


## Epidemiology

* School: **The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**
* Professor: Lorraine Alexander and Karin Yeatts
* Book: 
    1. [Epidemiology: Study Design and Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439839700/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)
    2. [Design of Observational Studies](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1441912126/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)
* Focus: 
    * Quasi-Experimental Study Design
    * Effectively managing confounding risks
    * Causal Inference with a lack the element of random assignment to treatment or control
* **How I apply Epidemiological study at work**:
    1. Internet of Things (IoT):
        * Identifying risk factors for consumer returns: remorse return and warranty return.
        * Quantifying the strength of association between stability crashes, battery, camera, network connectivity, etc 
          and consumer returns (unstickiness) as well as consumer retentions (stickiness).       
        * Especially attractive when finding and understanding events that negatively impact on consumer since it's.
          morally unacceptable to purposely impose a negative service to consumer for experimentation purposes.
        * E.g. Smartphone, Wearable, Smarthome, Driverless cars, etc.
