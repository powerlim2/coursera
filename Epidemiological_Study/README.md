# [Epidemiology: The Basic Science of Public Health](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemiology/outline)


As a big data scientist in Motorola Mobility, I extensively used epidemiological approaches to find and measure associations in my projects at work.
Although Epidemiology theories are centered around the publish health, their effective statistical experiment designs to manage confounding variables can be directly applicable to many business cases in Motorola.
By combining big data capability (availability of large data set and capability to analyzing the large data set), Quasi-experiments became very cost-effective tool to identify meaningful associations.
Many successful stories and proven results of Epidemiological designs (e.g. Case-Control Study to identify Smoking-Lung Cancer association) are also helpful communicating the results back to business. 

I am glad that I found this course offer from UNC through Coursera and I decided to take this course over the weekend. This was a good opportunity to brush up my memories.
