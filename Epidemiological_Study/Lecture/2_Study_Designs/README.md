## Experimental Study Designs

Characteristics:
* Investigator generally determines who's getting the intervention and who's not getting the intervention.
* Investigator randomly **assigns** exposure
* Exposure is the intervention in Epidemiological studies.


### 1 Randomized Control Trials

![RCT](misc/RCT.png)

- Characteristics:
    - Randomly break down the sample into two groups and assign *drug* and *placebo*.
    - Used to test new drugs or medical treatments.
        - Drug or treatment is randomized: randomization helps to reduce or prevent bias.
    - *Intervention group and control group should be comparable in all aspects (Counterfactual)*.
    - Strongest evidence for causal inference.

- study types:
    1. individual intervention study (Unit of Analysis: individual)
    2. community intervention study (Unit of Analysis: community)
    
- Key Advantages:
    1. Reduces influence of other determinants of exposure and outcome (confounding)
    2. Strong evidence for causality or causal inference
    3. Temporality

- Key Disadvantages:
    1. Costly
    2. External validity - generalizability
    3. Narrow focus
    4. Ethical considerations


### 2 Clinical Case Crossover Trials

- Characteristics:
    - subject switch one treatment to the other over time.
    - Wash-out period between the two exposures.
    - Order of exposure is randomized.
    - Shorter interventions are preferred.


### Blinding

1. Non-blinded: 
    - Subject: Not blinded, Researcher: Not blinded, Analyst: Not blinded
2. Single-blinded
    - Subject or Research is blinded but Analyst is not blinded
3. Double-blinded
    - Subject and Researcher is blinded but Analyst is not blinded
4. Triple-blinded
    - Subject, Researcher and Analyst are all blinded

the purpose of a *double blind* study is to avoid observer and interviewee bias.


### Vocabulary

- Equipoise: genuine uncertainty about the benefits /harms of treatments or exposure
- Placebo: sham treatment that appears identical to the real treatment
- Compliance/ Adherence: whether or not participants follow treatment recommendations
- Intention-to-treat analysis: when subject are analyzed according to their treatment


## Non-Experimental Studies

Characteristics:
* Observational
* Investigator does not assign the intervention.
* Used when it's not ethical to random assign exposure to participants.


### Cohort Study

- Cohort: a group of persons sharing a common characteristic




* case-control study
* ecologic study
* cross-sectional study
