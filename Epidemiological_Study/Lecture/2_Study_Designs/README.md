## Experimental Study Designs

Characteristics:
* Investigator generally determines who's getting the intervention and who's not getting the intervention.
* Investigator randomly **assigns** exposure
* Exposure is the intervention in Epidemiological studies.


Examples:
* Randomized Control Trials
    - Randomly break down the sample into two groups and assign *drug* and *placebo*.
    - Used to test new drugs or medical treatments.
        - Drug or treatment is randomized: randomization helps to reduce or prevent bias.
    - *Intervention group and control group should be comparable in all aspects (Counterfactual)*.
    - Strongest evidence for causal inference.
    - study types:
        1. individual intervention study (Unit of Analysis: individual)
        2. community intervention study (Unit of Analysis: community)
    - Key Advantages:
        1. Reduces influence of other determinants of exposure and outcome (confounding)
        2. Strong evidence for causality or causal inference
        3. Temporality

* Clinical Case Crossover Trials
    - subject switch one trial to the other over time.


## Non-Experimental Studies

Characteristics:
* Observational
* Investigator does not assign the intervention.
* Used when it's not ethical to random assign exposure to participants.


Examples:
* case-control study
* cohort study
* ecologic study
* cross-sectional study
